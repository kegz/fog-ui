# fog-ui

fog-ui is an open-source React component library built on top of Material UI (MUI).
It provides reusable UI components and a shared theming system intended for teams
that build and maintain multiple React applications.

This project is community-driven and welcomes contributions of all kinds:
code, documentation, tests, ideas, and constructive feedback.

## Why fog-ui exists

Many teams use MUI successfully but end up duplicating:
- the same card patterns
- the same table layouts
- the same form abstractions
- the same theme logic

fog-ui exists to centralize those patterns into a **tested, typed, reusable library**
without locking consumers into a rigid design system.

Core goals:
- Consistency across applications
- Explicit, predictable APIs
- Strong test coverage
- Minimal magic

## Project values

We try to optimize for the following:

- **Clarity over cleverness**  
  Code should be readable first, impressive second.

- **Composition over inheritance**  
  Prefer composing MUI primitives instead of deep abstractions.

- **Stability over novelty**  
  This is a UI foundation, not a playground for trends.

- **Respect for contributors’ time**  
  Clear structure, tests, and documentation matter.

## Who this project is for

fog-ui is a good fit if you:
- already use MUI
- want shared UI foundations across apps
- care about test coverage and type safety
- prefer explicit APIs over hidden behavior

fog-ui is *not* intended to:
- replace MUI
- provide a full design system with opinions on branding
- support multiple styling frameworks

## Getting involved

### Ways to contribute

You do **not** need to write new components to contribute.

Valuable contributions include:
- improving documentation or examples
- adding or refining tests
- fixing bugs
- improving types
- proposing API improvements
- reporting issues with clear reproduction steps

### Before opening a PR

Please ensure:
- the code builds locally
- tests pass
- new behavior is covered by tests
- public APIs are documented or self-explanatory

We strongly prefer **small, focused pull requests**.

---

## Communication & conduct

- Be respectful and constructive
- Assume good intent
- Disagree with ideas, not people

Harassment, hostility, or dismissive behavior will not be tolerated.

---

## Project status

fog-ui is actively developed and already used in real projects.
APIs may evolve, but stability and backwards compatibility are taken seriously.

Breaking changes will be documented clearly.

## License

fog-ui is released under the Apache-2.0 License.
See the LICENSE file for details.

## A note from the maintainer

This project exists because maintaining shared UI code *well* is hard.
If fog-ui saves you time or reduces duplication, that’s a success.

If you contribute, thank you — genuinely.
